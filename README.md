# Piano Tiles

Piano Tiles was at once an immensely popular mobile game, where the goal of the game is to press a set amount of tiles as fast as you can. I have simplified that and modified it to my own liking. My arcade game will go on indefinitely as long as the correct tiles are pressed. The score is constantly updated on the LCD screen; and if you lose, simply restart by pressing a button again.

In this project, I learned how to use multiple new components such as the LED matrix, the shift registers, and the joystick, and weave them all together to make a short, simple arcade game with replayability.


## Outputs
------------
The LED Matrix displays the tiles, and the LCD screen displays messages and the score. A sound buzzer also adds sound effects to the game upon each correct tile press.


## Inputs 
------------
Four buttons are used to select its respective columns, and I also added an extra feature where tilting the joystick up counts as the right two columns, and tilting the joystick down counts as the left two columns.
